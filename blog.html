              <strong>Week 1 - Software engineering experience</strong> Week 1
              was a really interesting experience of getting used to the
              refactory class schedule as well as some new tech concepts. The
              software engineering class in particular was a very interactive
              and interesting one that i really enjoyed and learnt alot from. I
              was introduced to new concepts like Git and HTML which are hard to
              understand at first but with time they made more sense. The course
              instructor Samson Kapeyi did a great job breaking down complicated
              topics and concepts(PS..he hates being called Mister for some
              reason &#x1F602&#x1F602&#x1F602).
              <br>
              We looked at how git is used both remotely and locally on a Computer.
               We also were told of the importance of version control and such tools
                for collaboration between developers.In HTML, we looked at the different 
                tags used in setting up the structure for webpages.

              This was a very interesting module that i learnt alot from.
              Honestly speaking i didnt have alot of interest at the beginning
              but with time i started to understand the inportance of this
              module. Mrs Julia did a wonderful job taking us through different
              topics concerning habits of effective people.I learnt the impact
              of the way we think and feel on our work and how it also
              influences those around us either positively or negatively.
              <br />
              We looked at being proactive which involves taking initiative and
              resposibility for my actions and choices as well as anticipating
              and acting on my future needs or challenges rather tham waiting
              for them to arise.We also looked at beginning with the end in mind
              which involves setting clear goals and envisioning the desired
              outcomes before starting the task which ensures that actions align
              with long-term objectives.Finally we saw the i,portance of putting
              first things firat where one prioritizes tasks based on urgency ,
              focusing on activities that contribute most to goals and values
              thereby managing time and resources effectively.

              <strong>Week 2 - Software engineering experience.</strong><p>
                In week
              two, saw fireee&#x1F525&#x1F525&#x1F525!!! (if you know you know &#x1F602&#x1F602&#x1F602).Jokes aside tho during
              this week, we delved into CSS and Bootstrap, essential tools for
              enhancing webpage aesthetics. It was initially straightforward to
              grasp CSS, but Bootstrap presented a more challenging learning
              curve. What seemed easy at first quickly revealed its
              complexities, requiring perseverance and deeper exploration. We
              looked at topics like the grid system in bootsrap and this
              puzzeled many minds including mine as it really didn't make sense.
              However with patience,rewatching of class recordings as well as
              coaching sessions,,,what seemed impossible turned into just
              difficult&#x1F605 which was a really big improvement to me.
              <br />
              This taught me patience in learning as some of this concepts make
              sense and become easier with time. I trust that I'll become better
              at these with more practice and exposure.

                >Week 2 - Leadership & Personal development experience.</strong>This was the week for wrapping up the module. Mrs Julia took us through the reamaining habits of highly effective people.
                  First we looked at the power of the habit of thinking Win-Win.This principle promotes collaboration and mutual benefit in interactions and negotiations.
                   It encourages seeking outcomes that satisfy all parties involved, fostering trust, respect, and long-term relationships. 
                    We then looked at seeking first to understand, then to be understood.This looked at how effective communication begins with empathetic listening and understanding others'
                     viewpoints. This habit emphasized the importance of listening attentively, acknowledging diverse perspectives, and genuinely empathizing before expressing one's
                      own ideas or opinions.
                      We also looked at synergy which involves leveraging collective strengths and differences to achieve greater outcomes together than individually possible.
                      It encourages collaboration, creativity, and innovation by combining diverse talents, perspectives, and resources. 
                      Lastly we looked at how to sharpen the saw.This habit emphasized continuous self-improvement and renewal in all dimensions of life—physical, mental, emotional, and 
                       spiritual. It involves proactive activities that enhance well-being, expand knowledge and skills, and maintain balance.
